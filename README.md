Character recognition task: classification of handwritten numerals

The inputs that make up this figure are inputs for each Network based 
on the number of input pixels (256 = 16x16 for Net-1). There are 10 outputs 
in this model for each of the digits classes from an image (class k, for k = 0,1,2,....,9). 
The desired function to learn is the predicted value fË†k(x).
